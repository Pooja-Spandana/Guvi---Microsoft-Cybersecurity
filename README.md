# Guvi---Microsoft-Cybersecurity

- Project Idea (in simple terms)
You are helping Security Operations Centers (SOCs) automatically decide whether a cybersecurity alert is:

A real attack (True Positive)
A safe/harmless situation (Benign Positive)
Or a false alarm (False Positive)

ðŸ”µ Goal:
Build a machine learning model that looks at past security incidents and predicts the correct label (TP, BP, FP) for new incidents â€” saving analysts tons of time.

ðŸ§  Simple Real-world Example
Imagine a security guard sees 100 alarms going off every day.

Some alarms mean real danger (robbery happening) â†’ True Positive
Some alarms mean it's safe (someone forgot their ID card but they're an employee) â†’ Benign Positive
Some alarms mean it was triggered by mistake (like a cat passing by) â†’ False Positive

You are training a robot to tell the guard which alarm is real, safe, or false â€” using data from past alarms!
